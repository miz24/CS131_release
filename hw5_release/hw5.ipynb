In other words, for a pixel of color $(r, g, b)$ located at position $(x, y)$ in the image, its feature vector would be $(r, g, b, x, y)$. However, the color and position features may have drastically different ranges; for example each color channel of an image may be in the range $[0, 1)$, while the position of each pixel may have a much wider range. Uneven scaling between different features in the feature vector may cause clustering algorithms to behave poorly.\n",
